Hi, my name is Nivaldo, I'm a DevOps engineer that loves software development, specially within networking/OS internals context. I'm no specialist yet, but everyday I'm trying to learn new things.

Some curiosities about me:
- Currently I work as a DevOps, but I've worked as a Data Analyst before and also some data engineering stuff
- I did a major in pure mathematics for about two years before starting a career in tech
